	<h1>Service Methods</h1>
	<p>At our company, we take house purchasing and payment very seriously. We believe that the best way to ensure a smooth and secure transaction is to do it in person, at our office. While we do provide information about our houses and services on our website, we do not allow online purchases or payments. Here are the reasons why:</p>

	<h2> Personal Attention</h2>
	<p>By doing business in person, we are able to provide our customers with personalized attention and guidance throughout the purchasing and payment process. This means that you can ask questions, get advice, and feel confident that you're making the right decision for your unique situation.</p>

	<h2> Security</h2>
	<p>We take the security of your personal and financial information very seriously. By not allowing online purchases or payments, we can ensure that your sensitive data is kept safe and secure at all times.</p>

	<h2>Transparency</h2>
	<p>We believe in being transparent and open with our customers. By doing business in person, we can provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision about your house purchase and payment options.</p>

	<p>So, while our website provides a lot of helpful information about our houses and services, please keep in mind that the purchasing and payment process must be done in person at our office. We look forward to meeting with you soon!</p>
